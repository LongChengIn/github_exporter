Change: Refactor structure and integrate more metrics

The structure of the repository should get overhauled and beside that we should
gather more metrics per organization and per repository. Additionally we should
also add support for GitHub Enterprise as requested within
[#10](https://github.com/promhippie/github_exporter/issues/10).
